## Or problem

There is a small bar that is expanding due to its great success. However, with expansion and without an order control system, customer service can be chaotic and confusing. For example, imagine that a customer makes a complex order, such as a customized burger with specific ingredients, accompanied by sweet potato fries and a drink. The attendant can write down the order on paper and deliver it to the kitchen, but there is no guarantee that the order will be prepared correctly.

Without an order control system, there may be confusion between attendants and the kitchen, resulting in delays in the preparation and delivery of two orders. Orders can be lost, misinterpreted or missing, leading to dissatisfied customers and loss of business.

In short, an order control system is essential to ensure that the lanchonete can serve customers efficiently, managing their orders and stocks appropriately. However, expanding a lanchonete can end up failing, resulting in dissatisfied customers and negatively impacting businesses.

To solve the problem, the lanchonete will invest in a fast food self-service system, which is composed of a series of devices and interfaces that allow customers to select and place orders without needing to interact with an attendant, with the functionalities presented in the requirements. the student portal.
